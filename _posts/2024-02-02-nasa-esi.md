[Fabien Evrard](../team/#principal-investigator) and lead-PI [Laura Villafa√±e](https://aerospace.illinois.edu/directory/profile/lvillafa), together with [Jesse Capecelatro](https://me.engin.umich.edu/people/faculty/jesse-capecelatro/) at Michigan, were recently awarded a NASA Early Stage Innovation grant. This collaboration aims to produce new physics-based models for predicting plume-surface interactions, as they occure during lunar or martian landing due to engine exhausts blowing away large amounts of regolith.

More information is available on the [dedicated NASA webpage](https://www.nasa.gov/general/integrating-data-driven-and-physics-based-models-for-plume-surface-interaction-predictions/).
