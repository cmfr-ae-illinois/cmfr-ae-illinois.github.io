The algorithm is based on a conservative finite-volume discretization with collocated variable arrangement, in which the discretized governing equations are solved in a single linear system of equations for pressure and velocity. Density is described by the polytropic Noble-Abel stiffened-gas model and the interface between the interacting bulk phases is captured by a state-of-the-art algebraic Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method. The new numerical algorithm is validated using representative test-cases of the interaction of acoustic waves with the gas-liquid interface as well as pressure-driven bubble dynamics in infinite and confined domains, showing excellent agreement of the results obtained with the proposed algorithm compared to linear acoustic theory, the Gilmore model and high-fidelity experiments.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The evolution of the capillary breakup of a liquid jet under large excitation amplitudes in a parameter regime relevant to inkjet printing is analysed using three-dimensional numerical simulations. The results exhibit a reversal of the breakup length of the jet occurring when the velocity scales associated with the excitation of the jet and surface tension are comparable, and an inversion of the breakup from front-pinching to back-pinching at sufficiently large excitation amplitudes. Both phenomena are shown to be associated with the formation of vortex rings and a local flow obstruction inside the jet, which modify the evolution of the jet by locally reducing or even reversing the growth of the capillary instability. Hence, this study provides a mechanism for the well-known breakup reversal and breakup inversion, which are both prominent phenomena in inkjet printing. An empirical similarity model for the reversal breakup length is proposed, which is shown to be valid throughout the considered range of characteristic parameters. Hence, even though the fluid dynamics observed in capillary jet breakup with large excitation amplitudes are complex, the presented findings allow an accurate prediction of the behaviour of jets in many practically relevant situations, especially continuous inkjet printing.},

  abstract = {In some applications of large-eddy simulation (LES), in addition to providing a closure model for the subgrid-scale stress tensor, it is necessary to also provide means to approximate the subgrid-scale velocity field. In this work, we derive a new model for the subgrid-scale velocity that can be used in such LES applications. The model consists in solving a linearized form of the momentum equation for the subgrid-scale velocity using a truncated Fourier-series approach. Solving within a structured grid of statistically homogeneous sub-domains enables the treatment of inhomogeneous problems. It is shown that the generated subgrid-scale velocity emulates key properties of turbulent flows, such as the right kinetic energy spectrum, realistic strain--rotation relations, and intermittency. The model is also shown to predict the correct inhomogeneous and anisotropic velocity statistics in unbounded flows. The computational costs of the model are still of the same order as the costs of the LES.},

  abstract = {Particle proper orthogonal decomposition (PPOD) is demonstrated as a method for extraction of temporal statistical information on dispersed (discrete) phases of multiphase flows. PPOD is an extension of the classical Eulerian POD, differentiating itself by its Lagrangian formulation and applicability to discrete phases in both stationary and non-stationary flows. The method is demonstrated on a test case of decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence, where particle data are generated by one-way coupled simulations. Here, particle positions and velocities are integrated forward in time in a Lagrangian manner. The results demonstrate a proof of concept of the PPOD, and its potential for applicability. It is demonstrated that PPOD modes are able to capture both large scale temporal flow features as well as smaller scale variations. Additionally, particle trajectories/velocities are approximated using a subset of the PPOD basis where convergence is demonstrated. In the application of PPOD on multiple particle realizations, an increase in the convergence rate is observed as the initial particle separation is decreased. When decomposing both solid (rigid) and fluid particle velocities, the method provides the possibility of modal analysis of fluid--particle interactions in multiphase flows. For various configurations of rigid particle densities, the modal parallelity between the two phases is mapped, revealing a higher parallelity when the rigid particles are neutrally buoyant.},

  abstract = {In particle-laden turbulence, the Fourier Lagrangian spectrum of each phase is regularly computed, and analytically derived response functions relate the Lagrangian spectrum of the fluid and the particle phase. However, due to the periodic nature of the Fourier basis, the analysis is restricted to statistically stationary flows. In the present work, utilizing the bases of time-focalized proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), this analysis is extended to temporally non-stationary turbulence. Studying two-way coupled particle-laden decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence for various Stokes numbers, it is demonstrated that the temporal POD modes extracted from the dispersed phase may be used for the expansion of both fluid and particle velocities. The POD Lagrangian spectrum of each phase may thus be computed from the same set of modal building blocks, allowing the evaluation of response functions in a POD frame of reference. Based on empirical evaluations, a model for response functions in non-stationary flows is proposed. The related energies of the two phases is well approximated by simple analytical expressions dependent on the particle Stokes number. It is found that the analytical expressions closely resemble those derived through the Fourier analysis of statistically stationary flows. These results suggest the existence of an inherent spectral symmetry underlying the dynamical systems consisting of particle-laden turbulence, a symmetry which spans across stationary/non-stationary particle-laden flow states.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            In Lagrangian stochastic collision models, a               fictitious               particle is generated to act as a collision partner, with a velocity correlated to the velocity of the               real               colliding particle. However, most often, the fluid velocity seen by this fictitious particles is not accounted for in the generation of the fictitious particle velocity, leading to a de-correlation between the fictitious particle velocity and the local fluid velocity, which, after collision, leads to an unrealistic de-correlation of the real particle velocity and the fluid velocity as seen by the particle. This de-correlation, in turn, causes a spurious decrease of the particle kinetic energy, even though the collisions are assumed perfectly elastic. In this paper, we propose a new model in which the generated fictitious particle velocity is correctly correlated to both the real particle velocity and the local fluid velocity at the particle, hence preventing the spurious loss of the total particle kinetic energy. The model is suitable for small inertial particles. Two algorithms for integrating the collision frequency are also compared to each other. The models are validated using large eddy simulation (LES) of mono-dispersed particle-laden stationary homogeneous isotropic turbulence.

The proposed phase POD method is herein applied to a periodically forced statistically non-stationary lid-driven cavity flow, implemented using the snapshot proper orthogonal decomposition algorithm. Space-phase modes are extracted to describe the dynamics of the chaotic flow, in which four central flow patterns are identified for describing the evolution of the energetic structures as a function of phase. The modal building blocks of the energy transport equation are demonstrated as a function of the phase. The triadic interaction term can here be interpreted as the convective transport of bi-modal interactions. Non-local energy transfer is observed as a result of the non-stationarity of the dynamical processes inducing triadic interactions spanning across a wide range of mode numbers.},
